I designed and developed a responsive dashboard to address the profit and trend analysis nee of Superstore Mall from 2014-2017.
Superstore Mall required a data-driven solution to analyze profit trends and make informed decisions based on historical data.The responsive dashboard is equipped with features that allow for dynamic visualizations and insights into profit trends. It offers a user-friendly interface for easy data exploration.
I utilized MS Excel and its formulas like: VLookup, Pivot tables, and slicers to create this responsive dashboard.
I approached this project with a focus on delivering an intuitive user experience (UX) and an aesthetically pleasing user interface (UI).
